To get this running, you should

1. Copy and paste this into your root
2. Install Vundle
3. Make sure any of your existing vim files correctly link and reference these dotfiles. 
4. Inside vim, in command mode, run `PluginInstall` and it should list out what plugins were included and install them, then show a Done message in the command line. 
5. If you aren't seeing a Monokai-style color scheme, make sure your vim is referencing the `/colors` directory.
